<p>This year’s AFL Grand Final Symposium took place on Friday 29th September, 2017. These days, I usually attend any seminar, symposium, or conference with my sketchnoting gear* in tow. This time, I decided to travel light. I live-tweeted periodically throughout the day, as did a few others, but I didn’t do any live sketchnoting as I normally would.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a while (years, really) about capturing my sketchnoting process as it happens. Then it struck me – with key messages from the symposium fresh in my mind, I could easily create a post hoc sketchnote of the event while capturing the process as a screen recording. Three tutorials and some new software installations later, <em>et voila</em> – <strong>here’s a timelapse video that demonstrates my sketchnoting process from start to finish.</strong> It captures, in ~2 min, what actually took me over 2 hours to create in real time. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>For those inquiring minds who want to know what I use to create my sketchnotes, here’s the nitty gritty:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>iPad 3</em></li>
<li><em>GoodNotes app</em></li>
<li><em>Adonit Jot Pro stylus</em></li>
<li><em>I write and draw by hand (i.e., the text you see is my handwriting – not a typeface!)</em></li>
</ul>
