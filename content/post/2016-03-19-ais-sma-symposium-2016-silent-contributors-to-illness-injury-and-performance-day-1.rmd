The 2016 Australian Institute of Sport / Sports Medicine Australia Symposium took place on March 18 & 19, exploring the theme of ‘Silent Contributors to Illness, Injury, and Performance’. Given the calibre of presenters in attendance, I’ve been looking forward to this event for some time and I can safely say that the wait has been worth it!
