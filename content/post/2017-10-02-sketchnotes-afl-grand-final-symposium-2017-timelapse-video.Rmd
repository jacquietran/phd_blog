This year's AFL Grand Final Symposium took place on Friday 29th September, 2017. These days, I usually attend any seminar, symposium, or conference with my sketchnoting gear* in tow. This time, I decided to travel light. I live-tweeted periodically throughout the day, as did a few others, but I didn't do any live sketchnoting as I normally would.

I've been thinking for a while (years, really) about capturing my sketchnoting process as it happens. Then it struck me – with key messages from the symposium fresh in my mind, I could easily create a post hoc sketchnote of the event while capturing the process as a screen recording. Three tutorials and some new software installations later, *et voila* – **here’s a timelapse video that demonstrates my sketchnoting process from start to finish.** It captures, in ~2 min, what actually took me over 2 hours to create in real time. Enjoy!

*For those inquiring minds who want to know what I use to create my sketchnotes, here’s the nitty gritty:*

- *iPad 3*
- *GoodNotes app*
- *Adonit Jot Pro stylus*
- *I write and draw by hand (i.e., the text you see is my handwriting – not a typeface!)*
